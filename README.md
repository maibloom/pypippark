# pypippark

PyPipPark functions as an organized haven for Python pip dependencies, efficiently gathering and managing an extensive range of Python libraries in a dedicated location, which provides developers with a streamlined and permanently accessible solution to optimize their workflow. 

---
## Theory

The Theory is to install any dependency in a dedicated location of your system and run it from that specific place only.

> [!CAUTION]
> As Pypippark installs packages inside ```/``` directory, make sure it has free space to install and use heavier dependencies.
